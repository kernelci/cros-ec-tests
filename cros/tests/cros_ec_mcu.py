            Coming out of reset, the MCU boot into its RO firmware and
            jumps to the RW version after validate its signature. If the
            protocol used in RO version is different of the RW version, when
            a reboot is issued the AP still uses the protocol version queried
            before transition, this causes the AP to no communicate correctly
            with the RO firmware and thus it doesn't switches to RW firmware.

            This test detects the that situation and reports a failure when
            the embedded controller is not able to transition from RO to RW,
            which is an indication that there is a problem.

            The above issue was fixed with the kernel patch 241a69ae8ea8
            ("platform/chrome: cros_ec: Query EC protocol version if EC
            transitions between RO/RW).
